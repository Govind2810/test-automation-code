* git stash is a powerful command in Git that allows you to temporarily save (stash) changes youâ€™ve made to your working directory 
without committing them.

# Make some changes to your files

# Stash the changes
git stash

# Your working directory is now clean
# You can switch branches or work on something else

# To see the list of stashed changes
git stash list

# To apply the most recent stash
git stash apply

# To apply and remove the stash
git stash pop

# To drop a specific stash (e.g., stash@{0})
git stash drop stash@{0}
